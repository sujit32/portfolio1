        <h1>Astha Neupane</h1>
        <h3>I'm a <span class="text"></span></h3>
        <p>
          I recently graduated from GITAM University with a Bachelor of Science
          degree in Nursing. I would say that I am a hardworking, caring, and
          responsible person. Being knowledgeable in the medical field is an
          ongoing process and I am always seeking opportunities to grow and
          develop myself by experiencing things in my field, nursing. I am
          flexible and adapt to situations accordingly. I am passionate about my
          work, and being a student nurse was very challenging, requiring time
          management and willpower. Each shift involved dealing with patients,
          understanding and encouraging them, and interacting with visitors, all
          while managing my studies.

        <h3>INTERNSHIP</h3>
        <p>
          During my internship at GIMSR Hospital in Visakhapatnam from April
          2023 to October 2023, I participated in various clinical activities
          including assessing vital signs, administering medications under
          supervision, calculating doses, documenting patient information,
          managing wound care and monitoring healing progress, and assisting in
          emergencies in the EMT department. Additionally, during my community
          internship, I conducted home visits to assess the health needs of
          individuals and families, provided health education, and promoted
          disease prevention methods.

          A descriptive study was conducted to assess the knowledge regarding
          lifestyle modification for improving the quality of life in chronic
          renal failure patients undergoing hemodialysis at GIMSR Hospital,
          Visakhapatnam. The tools used for data collection included demographic
          and knowledge assessment instruments. Researchers selected 40 samples
          for their study and collected data using a structured questionnaire
          related to knowledge assessment. The study findings indicated that the
          majority of the patients, 47.5%, were in the age group above 51 years.
          Additionally, 47.5% were male, 72.5% were Hindu, 65% were employed,
          and 42.5% were educated. The pretest results showed that 47.5% of
          patients had average knowledge, while 52.5% had poor knowledge. After
          providing the self-instruction module, the majority of patients (80%)
          demonstrated excellent knowledge. Researchers identified the
          effectiveness of the self-instructional module through an unpaired
          t-test, which yielded a value of 21.23 at the 0.05 significance level.
          The study results also indicated that knowledge assessment scores were
          dependent on selected demographic variables.
